# Informal Work Platform - A Digital Solution for the Gig Economy

## 📌 Overview
India has millions of informal workers, such as plumbers, electricians, drivers, tailors, and daily laborers, who struggle with inconsistent work, unfair payments, and lack of an online presence. This platform provides a **digital marketplace** where customers can find, hire, and pay verified workers directly, ensuring fair pay and eliminating middlemen.

## 🚀 Features
### **Customer Side (People Looking for Services)**
- 🔍 Search by service (e.g., plumber, tailor, tutor, mechanic)
- 📜 View worker profiles (ratings, reviews, pricing)
- 📅 Book instantly or schedule work
- 💳 Secure payments via UPI, Wallet, or Cash

### **Worker Side (Gig Workers & Informal Professionals)**
- 📝 Create a profile (skills, experience, location)
- ✅ Accept job requests and manage bookings
- ⏳ Set availability and pricing
- 💰 Receive secure payments directly

### **Admin Panel (Platform Management)**
- 🔐 Worker verification via KYC
- ⚖️ Dispute resolution system
- 📊 Data insights on demand trends

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
| Feature                | Tech Stack                              |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------------|
| **Profile & Verification** | Firebase Auth (or Supabase) + KYC Integration |      |
| **Chat & Notifications** | WebSockets for real-time interaction |
| **Payments & Earnings** | Razorpay / Stripe for secure payments |
| **Reviews & Ratings**  | Firestore DB with a weighted rating system |

## 💰 Monetization Strategy
1. **Commission on bookings** (5-10% per completed job)
2. **Subscription for workers** (premium profiles, priority job listings)
3. **Advertisements & Promotions** (local businesses and service providers)
4. **Corporate Tie-ups** (factories, hotels, and businesses needing workers)

## 📍 Why This Model Works in India
- **📈 Huge Market** – Over 450 million informal workers need digital access to jobs.
- **⚡ Low Competition** – No major players focus exclusively on this segment.
- **🏛️ Government Support** – Aligns with Digital India & MSME growth initiatives.

## 🏗️ MVP Roadmap

✅ Worker Registration (Name, Skills, Location, ID Verification)  
✅ Search & Booking System (Customers find workers & request jobs)  
✅ Payment System (Secure online transactions)

### **Phase 2: Regional Launch**

📌 Partner with local NGOs & government agencies for worker onboarding  

### **Phase 3: Expansion & Scaling**
